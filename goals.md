At the highest level, my career goals are rather simple: I want to do work that
I enjoy, and I want to build or improve high-quality products while doing so. I
want to use my passion for what I call “comprehensive UX” to drive a great computing
experience for the public. I want to challenge myself and learn more skills in
computer science, engineering, and teamwork. I want to be part of a team
innovates.

Comprehensive UX is the practice of thinking about UX even when making seemingly
technical or extremely low-level software decisions. For example, the programming
language a project is written in will not only impact development but also the
user. You can see this in action on Android: the platform’s reliance on Java
heavily influences the internal design of the system and, therefore, the user
experience. Comprehensive UX also encompasses the user experience of the developer
working on the project. A project that is easy to maintain, is clearly and concisely
programmed, and is enjoyable to work on will naturally have a better user experience
than a project that isn’t these things. For these reasons, I strive to think about
user experience in all of the code I write and the decisions I make for a project.
I want to bring this mentality to my workplace, where I can use my focus on
comprehensive UX to help build a great experience for both my users and my
coworkers.

Challenging myself has gotten me to where I am today. I have learned most of my
computer science skills outside of a classroom. Instead, I tried to make something
cool, ran into problems along the way, and taught myself how to solve them. I
believe that there will always be room to grow, especially in an industry like
computer science. A challenging work environment will facilitate my growth as a
specialist and as a person.

I believe teamwork, especially on a team of people with diverse interests and
backgrounds, is incredibly important. Different perspectives on the same issues
will always lead to a higher quality solution, and I love quality. Teamwork makes 
engineering possible and fun. No one person can sustainably build a large and
successful product while maintaining its quality, so a team is essential for a
good UX at scale.
