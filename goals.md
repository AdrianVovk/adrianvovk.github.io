TODO: Put this here

> Think of this section as the expanded version of the profile/objective from your résumé.  Feel free to restate that objective at the top of this tab and then go into all the detail stripped out by résumé conventions.  See Carmen resources for more information on this section. The length is ultimately up to you.  In general, 2-3 well-written paragraphs will be sufficient for purposes of the assignment.  The audience (employers in your chosen field) should get a clear sense of your professional ethos, drive, and determination from this section.
