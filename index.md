Hello! I’m Adrian and I am a first-year Computer Science and Engineering major
at The Ohio State University. I’m passionate about complex software stacks and
their integration into user experience. I believe that apps cannot provide users
with great experiences if the platform they are running on is not designed from
the ground up for UX. Analogously, a platform cannot provide a great user experience
unless its internals and code are approachable. Quality breeds quality.

I started programming when I was nine years old, and since then I’ve been working
to improve my computer science, engineering, and teamwork skills. I am deeply interested
in how computers work at the low level, and I will take many OS-development classes
at my university. The huge complexity that emerges out of small components all
interacting together in simple predefined ways fascinates me. I am a big advocate
for Free Open Source Software, and I have contributed code to various open source
projects through my work.

This website is my portfolio: a detailed explanation of my career goals can be
found [here](/goals), my standard resume can be found [here](/resume), and an
overview of some of the projects I’ve worked on can be found [here](/work).
