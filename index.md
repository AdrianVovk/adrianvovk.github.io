Hello! I’m Adrian and I am a third-year Computer Science and Engineering major
at The Ohio State University. I'm an advocate for Free and Open Source Software,
and I have made contributions to notable open source projects like systemd and
GNOME. I'm also passionate about OS development, and specifically my Linux
distribution: [carbonOS](https://carbon.sh). You can read more about it
in my [sample work](/work) page.

I was introduced to software development at a very young age, and for as long as
I can remember I've been working to improve my computer science, engineering, and
teamwork skills. I am deeply interested in low-level computing, and I am taking
many OS- and compiler-development classes at my university.

This website is my portfolio: my standard resume can be found [here](/resume), and an
overview of some of the projects I’ve worked on can be found [here](/work). You
can find my contact information and links to my various Git accounts in the
footer below.

You can find my GPG public key [here](/assets/pubkey.gpg).
