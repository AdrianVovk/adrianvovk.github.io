> The “home” tab should be the first page that appears when anyone visits your site.  Most of the design options in WordPress will automatically include this as the first tab.  You should make this page your “static” front page.   As it is the first page your visitors will see, it should make a good first impression.  Think of this tab as equal parts welcome, cover letter, and navigation instructions.  It serves many of the same functions as the cover letter and should: 
> - serve as an introduction to you (the “you” interested in applying for jobs in your field),
> - detail your interest in your chosen field (Civil Engineering, Marketing, etc.), and
> - provide an overview of the information contained on your site (and where to find it).
